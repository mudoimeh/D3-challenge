## Background

Welcome to the newsroom! After accepting a data visualization position for a major metro paper. The task is to analyze the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand the findings.

The editor wants to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. She's counting on me to sniff out the first story idea by sifting through information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: [https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml), but you are free to investigate a different data set. The current data set incldes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."


### Level 1: D3 Dabbler


Created a scatter plot between two of the data variables `Healthcare vs. Poverty` 

Using the D3 techniques, created a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. Coded the graphic in the `app.js` file making sure to pull in the data from `data.csv` by using the `d3.csv` function. The scatter plot should ultimately appear like the image at the top of this section.

* Included state abbreviations in the circles.

* Created and situated the axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.

* You'll need to use `python -m http.server` to run the visualization. This hosts the page at `localhost:8000` in your web browser.
